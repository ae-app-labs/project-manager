<h3>Project Work History</h3>Project Manager Development Info<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Upto Version 1.6<br />----------------<br />- Various basic activities including project design, UI design and implementation, basic codings. Since the Project Manager program was unable to manage itself without being developed, exact activity information is unavailable, 1610[10:38 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- More formatting to the work history information , 1611[10:40 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- Added a clear button for the Work history page , 1616[10:43 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- Increased the width of the label displaying the name of the current project in projectMonitor to hold a long name , 1617[10:44 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- Added a vertical scrollbar to the Work History list in projectMonitor , 1618[10:47 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- Regrouped the buttons on projectMonitor, a little bit of background redesign needed , 1619[10:52 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- program incremenets the version automatically after Updating the History list and the XML db , 1620[10:54 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- program updates the updates version of the current project into the XMLdb when writing each history item , 1621[11:02 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- added controls for following work times in projectMonitor , 1622[11:14 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- loads the times from the xml db into appropriate text boxes , 1623[11:23 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- textboxes displaying times aligned to right , 1624[11:23 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- added reset btn to timer panel , 1625[11:27 AM 1/20/2007]<br />- program displays its version in the title along with name , 1626[1:45 PM 1/20/2007]<br />- successfully implemented timer to calculate time duration between pressing of the start button and the stop button in projectMonitor, also we use a timer control to update this information to a textbox, 1627 [2:19 PM 1/20/2007]<br />- successfully implemeneted adding of process duration to the existing time, 1628 [4:18 PM 1/20/2007]<br />- moved the code to get the time offsets into a function in operations Module, using fn calls to directly change the value in the corresponding textbox, 1629 [4:25 PM 1/20/2007]<br />- Formatted the string returned by getTimeOffset in operations module, 1630 [4:38 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- took out the btn SelectNone from projectMonitor, 1631 [4:44 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- resized and moved the buttons on projectMonitor timer control panel around, 1632 [4:50 PM 7/20/2007]- when the radiobuttins for selecting what time to update, the corresponding textboxes have their backcolor changed, 1634 [5:12 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- successfully updated the new time into the XML db, 1635 [5:27 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- added a variable to monitor if the timer is still running when the update time btn is presse, we explicitly stop the timer, 1635 [5:40 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- Successfully foresaw and caught a possible exception in Update Time in projectMonitor, 1636 [5:43 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- when the program loads, the current version is incremented by 1 so that the user does not have to manually increment it before updating the history or use the same program version again, 1637 [5:50 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- redesigned the interface bg for projectMonitor, 1638 [11:45 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- ##[Note that all information, including the times taken during the development of this program are with effect from 20-July-2007, the day we implemented the timer for following the development time]##, 1638 [11:52 PM 7/20/2007]<br />- the program is using some 10 mb of memory, seems too much but the completely innovative design features make it attractive and different, 1639 [11:54 PM 7/20/2007]<br /><br />- creates new form for setting the program version manually, 1640 [12:45 AM 7/21/2007]<br />- minor bug in getTimeOffset in operations fixed, 1641 [1:13 AM 7/21/2007]<br />- able to manually enter project version through menu, but to update it, incr version button should be pressed. minor problem but thats the best workaround possible at present, 1642 [1:40 AM 7/21/2007]<br /><br /><br />- Designed style sheets with two themes for the report file generation, 1700 [5:46 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- design and code for binary file writer (internal development form, instead of developing as a separate application, we are developing it as a part of this project). it doesnt seem to write the input in binary format. so idea dropped., 1701 [8:07 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- Starting with GenerateProjectReport Form, 1702 [8:24 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- a small exception occured and fixed, 1703 [8:46 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- when custom styles check box is clicked, the state of the custom styles input box is toggled, 1704 [8:51 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- pressing the cancel button closes the form, 1705 [8:51 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- implemented stream reader to read the provided style information from the file, 1706 [8:57 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- Program reads html header from an external file, 1707 [9:04 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- using with statement to write data to the report file, 1708 [9:15 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- modified content in the HTMLHeader input file, 1709 [9:17 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- added checkbox to write work history into the report file as well, 1710 [9:46 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- moved the file reading operations from generateProject to the operations module, 1711 [9:51 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- after writing the report file, the generateReport form displays a message and upon closing it, the form is closed, 1712 [10:00 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- changed the menu item 'show on top' to 'always on top', 1713 [10:19 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- changed the name of the fn getTimeOffset in operations module to getAddedTime because here the times are added, and not offset calculated ;-), 1714 [10:33 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- writing code for calculating the total development time for the entire project, 1715 [10:38 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- completed preliminary code for generate report., 1716 [10:40 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- total project duration sum causes an error because of the formatting applied by the fn, 1717 [10:55 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- program has successfully written out the work history as well, 1718 [11:02 PM 7/23/2007]<br />- moved the input files into a subfolder 'data', 1719 [11:26 PM 7/23/2007]<br /><br />- when the custom styles radio button is clicked, the program loads the structure of the style sheet in the customStyles text box, when it is not selected, the data is cleared, 1730 [10:21 PM 7/24/2007]<br />- monor bug fix, 1731 [10:23 PM 7/24/2007]<br />- removed the scrolbar of the custom styles text box to give more space, 1732 [10:24 PM 7/24/2007]<br /><br />- worked around the code to calculate the total development time taken for the project in generateReport, 1735 [4:53 PM 7/25/2007]<br />- changed the final parsing of the result from getAddedTime() in Operations for generating the report, 1736 [4:56 PM 7/25/2007]<br />- added username field to the report generated., 1737 [2:38 PM 7/26/2007]<br />- added report generation date to the report field, 1738 [2:40 PM 7/26/2007]<br />- calculated % of each development times and shows a small bar graph against the times an indication of their relative times, 1740 [3:19 PM 7/26/2007]<br />- added red theme and changed the name of the themes to some standardised ones, 1741 [3:23 PM 7/26/2007]<br />- small bug fix in reportGenerator, 1742 [9:36 PM 7/26/2007]<br />- a small formatting update to the generateReport module, 1743 [8:13 AM 8/3/2007]<br />- there seem to be a couple of bugs with the timer in projectMonitor, it some times calculates invalid times that prevent from using that field unless modified in the XMLdb file manually, after running for a long time, the timer would show -ve values which is just absurd, 1744 [8:14 AM 8/3/2007]<br /><br />- made the 'include work history' default in GenerateProjectReport because it would normally be needed in most cases when generating the report, 1750 [3:11 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- adding initial code for viewing work history, 1751 [3:13 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- successfully launched notepad from the code..., 1752 [3:21 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- trying to pass parameter to the prog, seems to cause exception, 1753 [3:22 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- ok it works. so we go to the next step, that is  just read from the db file and load the work history file as the argument to the notepad opening command, 1754 [3:24 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- ok successfully implemented showing of work history file, 1755 [3:33 PM 8/10/2007]<br />- added code for making the

1769 [10:50 PM 12/31/2007]<br />- since unable to find a fn to get the month name instead of number manually defining a fn with select case  to return the month name corresponding to the month number, 1770 [10:57 PM 12/31/2007]<br />- modification to the generateReport module, we are nopw going to implement writing of the current version in the report file as standard format rather than the internal format, 1771 [11:16 PM 12/31/2007]<br />- Success in writing Standard Format Project Version to the Generated Report File., 1772 [11:32 PM 12/31/2007]<br />- changed code in updateWorkhistory to add a new line at the end of each entry so that the final text is more readable, 1773 [9:25 AM 1/5/2008]<br />- success in implementing that, 1774 [9:28 AM 1/5/2008]<br />- Trying to catch the CTRL
